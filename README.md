## Automated Dependency Updates

### Overview

In this project, we have implemented an automated process for managing dependency updates using Dependabot, GitHub Actions, and a custom labeling system. This automation helps in keeping our dependencies up-to-date while ensuring that updates do not break our existing codebase.

### How It Works

1. **Dependabot Configuration**: Dependabot is configured to check for dependency updates periodically. When it finds updates, it creates pull requests (PRs) with these updates.

2. **GitHub Actions for Auto-Merging**: We have set up a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically merges Dependabot PRs under certain conditions. This workflow ensures that our main branch always has the latest and secure versions of dependencies.

3. **Custom Label - "Calendar Release"**: Before a Dependabot PR is merged, it is automatically labeled with "calendar release". This label helps in identifying PRs that are part of the automated dependency update process and allows for additional workflows or actions based on this label.

### Enabling GitHub Actions for PRs

We have enabled the repository setting under `Settings > Actions > General > Choose whether GitHub Actions can create pull requests or submit approving pull request reviews`. This setting allows our GitHub Actions workflows to interact with PRs, enabling the automated merge functionality.
Or If you do not, you need to use different GitHub token in dependabot-reviewer yaml file. 

### Workflow Details

The main components of our workflow are as follows:

- **Dependabot**: Scans our dependencies and opens PRs for any found updates.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Runs when a Dependabot PR is opened. It checks if the PR passes all required checks (like CI tests) and then adds the "calendar release" label. Once labeled and all checks are passed, the PR is automatically merged.
- **PR Monitoring**: Team members can monitor these automated PRs, ensuring that updates are consistent with our project requirements.

### Security and Best Practices

While automation simplifies dependency management, we prioritize security:

- **Automated Testing**: All updates go through our rigorous automated test suite to ensure compatibility and stability.
- **Manual Oversight**: Critical updates are reviewed manually by the team to ensure they meet our standards.
- **Immediate Revert**: In case of any issues post-merge, we have a process in place for the immediate reversion of changes.
